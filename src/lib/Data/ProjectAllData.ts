It plays a crucial role in maintaining financial health, ensuring accurate tax reporting, and making informed business decisions. With multiple sales channels, payment processors, and inventory changes, e-commerce bookkeeping can be more complex than traditional retail accounting. It involves tracking revenue, expenses, returns, fees, and taxes from platforms like Shopify, Amazon, or WooCommerce. Accurate bookkeeping helps online sellers stay compliant, monitor cash flow, and evaluate profitability. Leveraging tools like cloud accounting software and integrating with e-commerce platforms can simplify the process and improve financial transparency.",
